# ECED4402 - Real-Time Systems: Queues

This repository contains the implementation of queues for the ECED 4402 Real-Time Systems course. It builds on the base code for the STM32F411RE development board, with a focus on demonstrating the use of FreeRTOS queues for inter-task communication.

## Features
- Implementation of multiple tasks sending and receiving data via queues
- Example of queue-based synchronization between tasks
- Exploration of queue behavior under different conditions such as varying task delays

## Requirements
- STM32CubeIDE
- STM32F411RE Development Board
- FreeRTOS

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Import the project into STM32CubeIDE.
3. Build and run the program on the STM32F411RE board to observe task synchronization via queues.
